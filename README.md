Windows ID Generator
====================

This is just a tool for me to generate CLSID's, IID's, GUID's, etc. as needed to easily program with the WINAPI without using Visual Studio or MSVC

Note: While this tool is ran in Visual Studio with MSVC to generate the ID's, the ID's are then able to be used outside of the MSVC and with other programming languages
